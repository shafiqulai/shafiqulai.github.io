Welcome to my personal blog! 🚀

This is a space where I share technical insights, experiments, and tutorials based on my work in **Computer Vision** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The blog reflects my journey, experiments, and learnings in building AI-powered systems that blend perception and reasoning.

## 🧠 Areas of Focus

### 🖼️ Computer Vision
- **Object Detection** – real-time and batch-level detection pipelines  
- **Image Segmentation** – instance and semantic segmentation for various domains  
- **Image Processing** – classical techniques and pre/post-processing for CV models

### 💬 LLMs and Reasoning Systems
- **ChatGPT / Gemini** – custom prompt engineering and advanced use cases  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – multi-source document QA and summarization  
- **Agents** – ReAct-style agents that reason, act, and interact with tools  
- **Vector Databases** – like ChromaDB, Pinecone, Qdrant for semantic retrieval  
- **Graph Databases** – for storing and reasoning over structured knowledge
